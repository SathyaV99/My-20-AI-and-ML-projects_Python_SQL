 Developed a **synthetic data generation model** to handle missing values in **wine quality data** based on its **chemical composition**. The dataset included attributes measuring the **chemical properties of wine**, and the goal was to **impute missing quality values (Low or High) using statistical methods and machine learning techniques**.

**What I Did**  
* **Data Preprocessing**: Identified and handled missing values in the dataset.  
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed variance inflation factors (VIFs) to assess feature multicollinearity.  
* **Synthetic Data Generation**: Used probabilistic modeling to generate synthetic data for missing quality labels.  

**Key Skills Demonstrated**  
* **Machine Learning for Data Imputation**: Used **Logistic Regression** to predict missing wine quality labels.  
* **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) Analysis**: Evaluated feature relationships to minimize multicollinearity.  
* **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Cleaned and transformed data for robust analysis.
