**SUMMARY**

The main objective of the project is to detect the faces in the image. In this project, images and masks were created, and using U net architecture and pretrained weights, the model was executed.

*Refer to "Project 17.ipynb" for all the details, the inference and the conclusions are also detailed within the notebook.*
