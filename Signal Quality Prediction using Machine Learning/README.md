**Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **predicting signal quality** for a **communications equipment manufacturing company** using **machine learning regression models**. The dataset contains **various measurable signal parameters**, and the goal is to build a **regressor that accurately determines signal strength** based on these parameters.

**What I Did**  

* **Data Import & Preprocessing**: Loaded signal test data, handled missing values, and removed duplicate entries.  
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis** to identify patterns in signal strength.  
* **Feature Engineering**: Created new features by **combining signal parameters** to improve model performance.  
* **Model Development**: Designed, trained, and tested a **neural network regressor** to predict signal quality.  
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimented with different architectures, activation functions, and optimization techniques.  
* **Model Deployment**: Saved the trained model using **pickle** for future use.  


**Key Skills Demonstrated**  

* **Regression Modeling**: Built a **neural network regressor** to predict numerical signal strength values.  
* **Data Analysis & Feature Engineering**: Applied **statistical techniques** to uncover hidden patterns in the dataset.  
* **Python & Libraries**: Used **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras** for model training and evaluation.  
* **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Experimented with **learning rates, activation functions, and network layers** for performance improvement.  
* **Model Serialization**: Used **pickle** to store the trained model for future use.
