**Project Overview**  
India is the second-largest smartphone market globally, making it crucial for businesses to understand consumer preferences. This project aimed to **develop a recommendation system** that suggests **smartphones based on user behavior and past ratings**. The system incorporates **popularity-based filtering** (to recommend top-rated phones) and **collaborative filtering** (to personalize recommendations based on similar users' preferences).

**What I Did**  

* **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Merged multiple datasets containing user ratings, reviews, and product details.  
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed **trends in smartphone ratings, consumer behavior, and rating distributions**.  
* **Feature Engineering**: Processed categorical and textual data, handled missing values, and normalized ratings.  
* **Popularity-Based Recommendation**: Implemented a model that ranks smartphones based on **average ratings and number of reviews**.  
* **Collaborative Filtering**: Built a **user-item matrix** using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for personalized recommendations.  
* **Model Evaluation**: Assessed performance using **precision-recall metrics and Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.  

**Key Skills Demonstrated**  

* **Recommendation Systems**: Implemented **popularity-based and collaborative filtering techniques**.  
* **Machine Learning & Data Analysis**: Applied algorithms to improve the accuracy of smartphone recommendations.  
* **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Cleaned and transformed data for optimal model performance.  
* **Python & Libraries**: Used **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Surprise** for recommendation system modeling.  
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Analyzed **MSE, precision-recall, and top-N recommendation accuracy**.
